            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Therefore the ſound is a way for to ſtirre up, and a ſchoole for exerciſing the voyce. Wherefore ſuch as will learne to ſpeake circumſpectly, let them not deny what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to nature, but what belongs to moderation, that let them obſerve, no otherwiſe then as an eſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all upon a beacon, let them ſee to that by watching, not by ſleeping.

It is the part of the younger ſort deſirous to bee good, to have the feare of God before their eyes, to honour their parents, to reverence their elders, to preſerve chaſtity, not to deſpiſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, to love gentleneſſe, and ſhamefaſtneſſe.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Herefore faire is the face, and ſweet is the grace of the vertue, modeſty, which is not only ſeene in thy deeds, but alſo in thy ſpeeches themſelves, that they exceed not the meane, that they ſound out nothing unſeemely. For the mirrour of the mind doth for the moſt part illuſtrate it ſelfe in the ſpeech; Let modeſty ſo poiſe the ſound of the voyce, that being ſtrained it offend not the eare. In the matter of ſong the firſt diſcipline is modeſty, likewiſe in the whole courſe of ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, in the degrees of ſinging to the inſtrument of muſicke, or in tuning, or compoſing the voyce, or laſtly in faſhioning ſweetly the tongue in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and firſt entrance, bluſhing, and awfulneſſe hath ever beene commendable, and much graced the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. In ſilence alſo it ſelfe wherein is the reſt, and repoſe of other vertues, modeſty beareth no ſmall ſtroake. If it be thought to proceed from chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhnes or pride, it is accounted a reproach, if from modeſty it is reputed a praiſe; <hi>Suſanna</hi> was ſilent in danger, &amp; did iudge the loſſe of life to be leſſe then the loſſe of modeſty, neither did ſhe think, that the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of her weale, was to be bought with the perill of ſuch a wracke.

                        </note> God, to whom was ever a paſſage given for chaſtity to open her mouth, though abaſhed, &amp; cloſed up, when ſhee beheld the impudent foreheads of faithleſſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers; For there is baſhfulneſſe in the very eyes, that a modeſt woman cannot looke up on men, but
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:265:52"/> avoideth their ſight. Neither is this the praiſe of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity only: for Modeſtie is the companion of ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſſe, by whoſe ſociety, chaſtitie is more ſecure; for ſhamefaſtneſſe is a good companion for the well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of chaſtitie: for lending her hand, and leading forward to the preventing of the firſt, and moſt fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full aſſaults, ſuffereth not chaſtity to be inſnared. This is that which in her entrance into knowledge is chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commended to the readers in the Mother of our Lord, and it is laid downe there, as a rich teſtimonie how worthy ſhee was to be choſen, and advanced to ſo high an honour, that being in ſecret, ſolitary in her<note n="c" place="margin">Luk. 1.20.</note> chamber, and ſaluted by an Angell, ſhee held her peace, and againe, that ſhee was<note n="d" place="margin">

Therefore although ſhee were humble, and curteous, yet for modeſtie ſake hee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting her, ſhee ſaluted him not, nor rendred him againe any anſwer, untill ſhee had knowledge of her conception by the Holy Ghoſt, and that to this end that ſhee might learne in ſilence, the divine qualitie of the fruite of her wombe, and leſt by her ſpeech ſhee might happily ſome way gaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay the voyce of the Angell.

Modeſtie likewiſe is to bee obſerved in the motion of the body, geſture, and gate. For the diſpoſition of the mind is ſeene in the ſtate of the body. Hence the hidden man of the heart is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lighter, or more boaſting, or more troubled and obſcure: or contrariwiſe more heavy, more conſtant, more pure, and more ripe. For the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the body is a kind of ſpeech of the mind. Yee may remember (my ſonnes) a certaine friend, when hee ſeemed to commend himſelfe for his ſedulity in duties, for this only cauſe notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, not to have beene received by mee into the Clergie, for that hee carried himſelfe very unſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his geſture; Yee may remember alſo another, whom when I found to bee already admitted, I commanded never to goe before mee, becauſe with the ſtroake of his inſolent gate hee much wounded mine eyes And this I ſpeake, becauſe when after an offence hee was reſtored to his office, againſt this only I toooke exception, neither was I deceived. For both of them departed from the Church, caſt off their profeſſion: ſo that what their geſture did bewray; the ſame at length did the trecherie of their mind demonſtrate. For one of them in the time of infeſtation of the <hi>Arrian</hi> hereſie for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooke the faith, the other leſt hee ſhould bee called
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:265:53"/> into queſtion to the loſſe of his money, which hee much deſired to keepe, denied himſelfe to bee a prieſt after our profeſſion. The image of lightneſſe appeared in their gate, and a certaine picture of runnagate ſcoffers. There bee ſome which by walking leaſurely, and ſtately, imitating the geſture of ſtage-players, and as it were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Pageants, and ſhewes repreſented in pompe, and triumph, that as oft as they ſteppe forward, ſeeme to keepe certaine meaſures. Neither doe I thinke it fit to walke haſtily, unleſſe when ſome cauſe of danger, or juſt neceſſitie ſhall require. For wee ſee ſuch as goe apace being conſtrained, to pant, and blow, to wring, and wreſt their mouthes, and diſguiſe their countenances; to whom if there bee wanting a cauſe of juſt feſtination, it is a wart in the face of our converſation, and of juſt offence. I ſpeake not of thoſe, which uſe properation very ſeldome, and alſo in the forenamed reſpects: but of ſuch, with whom by daily, and continuall cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome it is turned into an habite, and another nature. I allow not therefore in thoſe that they ſhould bee as the portraiture, and ſhape of ſtatues, nor in theſe that they ſhould bee as ruines of things ſhaken, and ſhattered in peeces. There is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide theſe a manner of gate, which is approved, wherein namely there is the ſemblance of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, the weight of gravitie, the ſteppe of tranquillitie: but ſo if ſtudie for the attaining, and affectation bee wanting, and it proceed from a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, pure, and ſimple gift incident to nature, not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured, not counterfeit. For nothing forged, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced pleaſeth; Let nature it ſelfe frame, and faſhion our motion. If there bee any errour in nature, let induſtry correct it: admit there be want of due skill to correct, yet faile not by ſome meanes or other to correct, and redreſſe the fault. If wee looke
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:265:53"/> more throughly into theſe things how ought wee to beware, and that much more, leſt any unſeemely thing proceed out of our mouthes? For this grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly delfileth a man; For meate defileth not a man but unjuſt obtrectation, and obſcenity of words. Hereof even the vulgar ſort themſelves are aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the duty that wee treate of, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to our function of teaching, there is no word that falleth diſhoneſtly, or diſorderly from us, but it cauſeth bluſhing. Nay wee ought not our ſelves only to utter nothing uncomely, but with <hi>Ioſeph</hi> not once to lend our eare to the ſame, or to whatſoever is unſavoury, who leſt hee might heare ſomewhat incongruent to his owne modeſty fled, leaving his garment behind him; Becauſe hee that delights to heare, provokes another to ſpeake: wee are to underſtand likewiſe that what is obſcene brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth much ſhame. But to obſerve, if any ſuch thing falleth out by chance, how much horrour diſtreſſeth? what therefore wee diſlike in others, can wee poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conceive a liking of in our ſelves? Nature it ſelfe teacheth no leſſe, and hath explicated perfectly all the parts of the body, that it might ſerve both for neceſſity, and for ornament. But notwithſtanding thoſe, which might bee comely for ſight, in which the toppe and excellency of the workmanſhip pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as it were in a tower, both the ſweetneſſe of the forme, and the beauty of the countenance might ſhine forth, and the uſe of exerciſe might bee more ready, ſhee hath left obvious and open. But thoſe in whom there muſt bee an yeelding to natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall neceſſitie, that they might not exhibite their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed ſpectacle, ſhee hath partly corrected, and obſcured in the body it ſelfe, and hath partly advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and perſwaded to cover. Is not therefore na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelfe the miſtreſſe of modeſty? After whoſe
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:265:54"/> example the modeſty of men (which<note n="k" place="margin">Modeſtiae Etymologia eſt à modo ſcientiae ejus quod deceat.</note> I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to have beene denominated from the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the knowledge of things as might beſt beſeeme) what it hath found hidden in this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricke of our body, it hath ſhadowed, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, as that dore in the Arke made over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart the ſame commanded to juſt <hi>Noe</hi>

Therefore the Maſter builder of all things, and Lady nature it ſelfe hath ſo provided for our modeſt carriage, hath ſo preſerved that comelineſſe, and honeſty in our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that hee might remove behind the backe, as it were, the chanells of the ſcouring of the ſtreetes, the emptying, and venting of our pipes, and might turne them out of the way from the ſight of our eyes, leſt the purging thereof might offend, and annoy them, whereof the Apoſtle worthily;<note n="m" place="margin">1 Cor. 12.23.</note> 
                        <hi>Thoſe members of the body which ſeeme to bee moſt feeble, are moſt neceſſary, and upon thoſe members of the body, which wee thinke moſt unhoneſt put wee more honeſty on, and our uncome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly parts have more comelineſſe on.</hi> For induſtry imitating nature brought more grace. But it is not here to be pretermitted, that wee doe not only hide from the eyes, but doe not ſo much as once call the uncomely parts by their names. Moreover, if they chance to bee diſcovered, our faces are covered with ſhame, and if any doe it of purpoſe, 'tis accounted impudencie. Whence <hi>Cham</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Noah</hi> is much blamed, hee ſeeing his father naked derided him: but his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren much commended, hee incurred a curſe, and that deſervedly, they a benediction, becauſe they caſt a garment upon him. It was an ancient cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:265:54"/> both in the city of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in other ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that ſonnes of ripe age, and ſonnes in law ſhould not preſume to enter into bathes or rivers, to waſh with their parents, leſt thereby the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and reverence due to them might be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired: albeit the moſt part alſo, even in the waſhing place, as farre as they can, doe cover themſelves, and for this cauſe, when for the reſt it is not greatly materiall, that this portion might the rather bee kept ſecret; The Prieſts of old put on linnen breeches<note n="n" place="margin">Exod. 24.48.</note> reaching from the loynes to the thighes to cover their nakedneſſe. <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſonnes were commanded of the Lord to have them when they entred into the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and when they came to the Altar to miniſter; the reaſon withall and danger is added, if they neglected the ſame, that they ſhould commit iniquitie, and ſo die. Which conſtitution ſome of our order are reported at this day to obſerve: but the moſt expound it after a ſpirituall manner, as a caution for modeſtie, and cuſtodie for cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie.</p>

If there bee any that requireth ought of us, let them rather come to us then expect that we ſhould come to them, what have we to doe with fables? our miniſtry belongeth to the altar of Chriſt, to be obſequious to men per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines not to us, that wee have received, for this wee have no warrant; It becomes us to be humble, meek, curteous, grave, patient, to keepe a meaſure, and moderation in all things; that our ſilent countenance no leſſe then our ſpeech may evidence the unblamea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe of our converſation.</p>

And therefore hee found ſo great
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:265:56"/> favour with God. Further, by how much<note n="f" place="margin">Geneſ. 33.3.</note> obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, and obeyſance, by how many great gifts did hee reconcile his brother to him, inſomuch that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred the ſatisfaction now tendered him, and remembred not the benediction before taken from him? Therefore if anger ſhall prevent, and foreſtall thy mind, and ſeaze upon thee, leave not thy place. Thy place is patience, thy place is reaſon, thy place is an abatement of indignation. And if the contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the anſwer ſhall move thee, and his perverſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe compell thee to indignation, if thou canſt not mitigate thy mind, repreſſe thy tongue. For ſo it is<note n="g" place="margin">Pſal. 34.13. 1 Pet. 3.11.</note> written, <hi>keepe thy tongue and thy lippes, that they ſpeake no guile;</hi> and afterward, <hi>ſeeke peace, and follow after it.</hi> See that peace of holy<note n="h" place="margin">Geneſ. 31.44.</note>

Theſe things uſed by us, the Orators of the world have put in their bookes; But the credit of ſuch moderation is his which firſt ſpake it. Let us therefore avoid, or moderate anger, leſt from hence there be excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on taken againſt us in the matter of our praiſes, and an exaggerating of our vices. It is a matter of no ſmall importance to mitigate anger: yea of no leſſe then not to be moved at all. The one belongs to us, the other is of a naturall inſtinct. Thoſe harmeleſſe motions are in children, who are more ready to ſhew kindneſſe, then bitterneſſe. And if children bee ſoone moved to indignation betweene themſelves, yet they are eaſily pacified, and their love refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth backe backe upon each other with greater ſweetneſſe. They are utterly to ſeeke how to deale ſubtily, and craftily one with another. By no meanes contemne not yee theſe children of whom he ſaith,<note n="i" place="margin">Math. 18.3.</note>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXI.</hi> Of the cogitations, the appetite, and comelineſſe of ſpeech in talking and arguing.</head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here bee double motions, that is, of the thoughts, and appetite, the one I ſay of the thoughts, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the appetite, not confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but ſevered and unlike. It is the part of cogitations to ſearch, and<note n="a" place="margin">Emolere.</note> and boult out the truth: the appetite ſtirreth, driveth forward to ſome action. Therefore generally in their owne nature it ſelfe, both the thoughts doe infuſe the tranquillity of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification, and the appetite doth ſhake, and ſhove forward the motion of doing. Let us therefore bee ſo informed, that the thought of good things may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon the mind, but the appetite let it obey reaſon, if wee would doe our true intent to keepe a <hi>deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> leſt our affection ſet upon ſome thing averſe thereunto doe exclude reaſon, and doe not permit it to examine what belongeth to honeſtie. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe for the preſervation of that which is comely wee ſaid before, this to bee very requiſite, to know what ought to be the meane to bee uſed in our words and deeds, and becauſe the order of ſpeaking is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the order of doing, underſtand that ſpeech is divided into two parts; That is to ſay, into familiar colloquie, or into a tractable, obvious to diſcourſe and diſceptation, as for example, when we argue of fidelity and juſtice, the rule in both muſt be that there be no perturbation of mind about this diſpute, but that the ſpeech be gentle, and calme, full of benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and grace, and free from all contumelie. Let pertinacious, and obſtinate contention in familiar
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:265:58"/> ſpeech be farre removed; for this, rather ſtirres up vaine queſtions then brings any profit. Let reaſoning bee without anger, let there bee pleaſantneſſe of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe without bitterneſſe, admonition without roughneſſe, exhortation without offence. And as in every action of our life we ought to beware leſt too much motion of the mind exclude not reaſon, but let us give place to counſell: ſo alſo it is meet in ſpeech to keepe that forme that neither anger be ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up, nor hatred, nor that wee expreſſe any token of our unlawfull deſire, or buſineſſe. Let therefore ſuch our ſpeech be ſpecially of the Scriptures. For what ought wee rather to ſpeake of then of good converſation, then of exhortation to the obſervation of divine precepts, then of the keeping, and due care of diſcipline? Begin we it upon ground of reaſon, and end we it in meaſure; For a tedious ſpeech get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not favour but indignation. But how unſeemly is it, that when all conference ſhould get grace, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth that blot of diſgrace an offence? A diſcourſe alſo of the doctrine of faith, of the rule of continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, of the diſquiſition of juſtice, of an exhortation concerning diligence, not one alwayes, but ſuch as ſhall be occaſioned upon our reading, is both readily to be taken hold of by us, and as we are able, to bee proſecuted: neither ſuch as may be too prolix, neither ſuch as may be ſuddenly interrupted, leſt ſo it might leave behind it loathſomeneſſe, or ſhould bewray ſlothfulneſſe or negligence. Let the forme of the ſpeech it ſelfe for the better expreſſion and ornament of the matter be ſimple, cleare, and manifeſt, full of grauitie and weight, not of affectate elegancy, but yet not without all grace, and neatneſſe.</p>

Herein three things are to bee obſerved, one that there bee not reluctancy betweene the appetite and reaſon. For, in this alone our dutyes are made anſwerable to that which is comely. For if our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite doe obey reaſon, that which is ſeemely in all duties may be preſerved. 2.<note place="margin">2. The induſtrie ought to bee proportionable to the ſubject.</note> Another is, that we doe not undertake any matter with greater, or leſſe care then is requiſite, or being ſmall wee doe not make much gaines about it, or being great, wee doe not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervalew it in our diligence. 3.<note place="margin">3. Moderation ought to bee uſed in labour with due reſpect to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and time.</note> The third is concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the moderating of our ſtudies and labours. Concerning alſo the order of things, and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of times, wee muſt not lightly paſſe by them, but deale therein effectually; But that is the firſt thing, and the foundation of all, that the appetite obey rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. The ſecond and the third conſiſting of induſtry are the ſame, that is, moderation in both, in the one reſpectively to the imployment, in the other to the order and time. The place of the bountifull dealing of God toward the forme of the perſon of man, which is accounted his beauty: and a contemplation of dignity lyeth vacant here with us. The order of things, and opportunity of times now followeth. In reſpect whereof wee are to diſcuſſe three queſtions all to this one head, whether we may truly teach that in any of the Saints all things were conſummate, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:265:60"/> done in that fulneſſe and perfection as is required? Firſt of all therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelfe the father of the faithfull being informed and inſtructed about the myſterie of future ſucceſſion, and <hi>commanded to depart out of his owne</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Geneſ. 12.1.</note> 
                        <hi>countrey and kinred; and from his fathers houſe,</hi> was hee not bound in affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on through the multiplicity of his acquaintance, friends and affinity: yet notwithſtanding did hee not bring his appetite under the obedience, and command of reaſon? For whom would not the favour and affection of countrey, kinred, and of his owne houſe delight? Even him therefore did the ſweetneſſe of theſe ſometimes mollifie, but ſo that the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the heavenly power, and remuneration eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall moved more, did hee not conſider his wife to be weake for the undertaking of labour, tender for the bearing of injuries, comely to provoke the inſolent, and not to bee conducted forth without great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger? and yet did hee not upon better conſideration chooſe to prevent the Lords purpoſe by ſuch excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and pretences? Moreover, when he went down into <hi>Egypt,</hi> hee admoniſhed her that ſhee ſhould ſay that<note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 12.13.</note> ſhee was his ſiſter, and not his wife. Marke of how great force his appetite was? Hee feared his wives chaſtity, he feared his owne ſafety, hee ſuſpected the inordinate luſts of the <hi>Egyptians:</hi> yet reaſon led him out ro doe that devotion. For he conſidered that hee being under the favour of God, hee might be ſafer whereſoever hee was: but the Lord being diſpleaſed, hee would bee in ſafety no where, no not in his owne houſe. Reaſon therefore overcame his appetite, and made him obedient. His nephew being taken by the enemy hee was not terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, neither was hee troubled with the many ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of ſo many and mighty Kings, but renewed the warres, and when he had enjoyed the<note n="c" place="margin">Gen, 14.23.</note> victory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed part of the ſpoyles, which hee himſelfe had
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:265:60"/> recovered. In the promiſed ſeed hee reſpected not the deadneſſe of his owne body, nor of his wives wombe, and that hee was now almoſt an hundred yeares old, yet beyond the uſe, and helpe of nature hee bleſſed God. Obſerve how all things doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord to the point. His appetite was not defective, but ſtrugled, and ſtrived with him for the dominion, but was ſuppreſſed. He was of a right judgement in the managing of affaires, hee was able to eſtimate things truly, and to diſcerne betweene thoſe of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and of leſſe conſequence. In his buſineſſe hee uſed moderation, and due order, tooke the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of time for every action, and in his words he kept weight and meaſure. For faith, hee was the firſt, and is for juſtice, the chiefeſt in battell, valiant in<note n="d" place="margin">Gen. 15.22.23.</note> victory, not greedy of gaine, in his houſe hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, toward his<note n="e" place="margin">Vxori ſedulus: ſedulus verò is dicitur, qui teſte Donato &amp; Nonnio, ſine dolo &amp; inſtanter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentus.</note> ſpouſe ſpecially and truly reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive. His holy nephew <hi>Iacob</hi> likewiſe delighting himſelfe in piety, liked to live at home in holy ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity under the wings of his godly parents, but his mother was deſirous hee ſhould ſojourne abroad thereby to give way to his brothers wrath. Her whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome counſell overcame his appetite of ſecuring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe there, and made him trie his hazard elſe-where; And ſo became he an exul from his home, and place of birth, and an alient from his parents; Yet where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever and whatſoever hee was, hee neglected not convenient meaſure, and opportunity in his affaires,<note place="margin">O beſtiall baſeneſſe when piety giveth place to the appetite the ſpirit to the fleſh, the ſoule to the body, where heaven is ſold for a little earthly content, eternity for that is momentary.</note> hee was received home to his parents. That the one draw thereunto by the fulneſſe of dayes might give him the bleſſing of obedience, the other might hang over him in her pious affection; Hee was preferred before his brother, even in his owne judgement, when hee yeelded him food for the ſatisfaction of his immoderate appetite, delighted was hee with food according to nature, but condeſcended accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to piety to what was ſought after. A faithfull
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:265:61"/> paſtor was this <hi>Iacob</hi> to his maſters flocke, a diligent ſonne-in-law, to a degenerating father-in-law, quick at labour, ſparing in diet, forward in giving ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, large, and liberall in recompence and reward. To conclude by this moderation hee ſo mitigated his brothers diſpleaſure, that whoſe anger he ſo much feared at the firſt, in the end hee procured his favour. What ſhall I ſay of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> who though hee had a deſire of liberty, yet was content to ſubject him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the neceſſity of ſervitude? Therein how did hee humble himſelfe, how conſtant was hee in a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous courſe, impriſonment how pliant and gentle, how wiſe in interpretation, moderate in authority, provident in time of plenty, juſt in time of famine, ordering and contriving all his affaires with commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation? how in his wiſdome did hee diſpence with the times untill fitteſt opportunity might bee taken for the execution of his office of juſtice, and untill equity might have beſt entrance among the people? According to this patterne <hi>Job</hi> alſo walked unblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably both in proſperity, and adverſity, was a man of admirable patience, carried a thankfull heart to God, and was in great acceptation with him: and yet was vexed and moleſted on every ſide outwardly: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit inwardly not without ſpeciall comfort. <hi>David</hi> likewiſe was a man of warre, and worth in fighting the Lords battels, in diſtreſſe of ſingular patience, ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling peaceably in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> in victory mercifull, ſo much grieved, and caſt downe for his ſinnes, as no man the like, in his old age provident for his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, hee obſerved ſo the moderation of things, the changes of times according to the comely ſounds of ſeverall ages, that hee may ſeeme to me no idle in his kind of living, then in his ſuavity of ſinging excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, ſweetly tohave poured out an immortall ſong of his owne demerits, to the honour of Gods great Name, and as a plat-forme of piety to us, was there
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:265:61"/> any duty therefore belonging to the principall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues following wanting in theſe men? Prudence hath the firſt place, and confiſteth in ſearching out of the truth, and conteyneth in it this property to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe a deſire to attaine daily a greater meaſure of knowledge. The ſecond place hath juſtice, which rendreth to every one his owne, doth not challenge that which pertaineth to another, neglecteth its own proper profit to preferre common equity. The third, fortitude which both in affaires of war for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of an high and noble courage, and alſo at home, and againe in the ſtrength of the body doth beare away the praiſe. The fourth, temperance, which ſerveth for the diſpoſing and moderating of all things whatſoever are to be done or ſpoken.</p>

It was juſtice to render againe what he had received. It was fortitude to reſtraine, and ſuppreſſe his appetite, and affection, and to give place to reaſon. His father brought him to God for a ſacrifice, but appointed thereunto, queſtioned how this might bee, there being no oblation in ſight, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was his fathers affection tryed, but not overcome.

Did not <hi>Moſes, who was learned in all the wiſdome of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians,</hi> make triall of the ſame? For hee judgeth it, whatſoever it was in the eſtimation of the world, meere folly and madneſſe, and the time ſpent about it utterly loſt, and for that cauſe his mind being averſe from it, hee ſought God with a pure<note n="b" place="margin">Hebr. 4.13.</note> affection, which made a way to the ſight, conference, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience that the Lord afterward vouchſafed him.

Hee tooke not things unknowne for knowne, neither did raſhly aſſent thereunto. Which two, thoſe men who

Wherefore how much more noble, and eminent a vertue wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is: ſo much the more earneſtly ought wee to ſtrive to attaine unto it. Therefore that we may nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinke, nor doe any thing againſt nature, that we may commit nothing unſeemly, or undecent, wee ought to bring theſe two to the conſideration of things for examination ſake, that is to ſay, both time and diligence. For there is nothing wherein man doth more excell the reſt of the living creatures then that he is partaker of reaſon, ſearcheth into the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of things, ſeeketh to know his Creator, in whoſe hands is the power of life, and of death, which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneth the world with his becke, and to whom we muſt know that wee are to render account of our actions. Neither is any thing more available to the leading of an honeſt life, then to beleeve that hee ſhall bee our Judge hereafter, whom nothing, bee it never ſo ſecret, can deceive, nothing uncleane, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely, diſhoneſtly, diſorderly carried, can doe other then offend, nothing vertuous, decent, honeſt, put in due order, or place can doe other but pleaſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; wherefore it is ingrafted in all men by nature to ſearch out the truth, becauſe this is as a loadſtone to draw on the ſtudy of knowledge, and as a whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone to ſharpen the deſire.

But the piety of juſtice is
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:265:65"/> firſt toward God, ſecondly toward our countrey and parents, and moreouer toward all, being it ſelfe alſo according to the chiefe rule of nature; For from our infancy when ſenſe begins firſt to bee infuſed, wee love life as that gift of God, we love our countrey, our parents, our equals; likewiſe to whom wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to bee linked in ſociety. Hence proceedeth cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, <hi>which not ſeeking her owne things preferreth others before her ſelfe,</hi> and this to doe, is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall worke of juſtice. It is a thing likewiſe ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in all living creatures, firſt to ſeeke their owne ſafety, to beware what may hurt, to deſire what may profit; As food, as their couches, whereby they may defend themſelves from dangers, ſhowres, the Sun which is part of wiſdome. Adde hereunto that all kindes of living creatures by a naturall inſtinct flocke together, firſt to thoſe of their owne kind, then next to thoſe of another kind, as wee ſee kine with their heards, horſes with their droves, eſpecially like with their like to be delighted. Stagges alſo to be joyned with Stagges, and for the moſt part with men. Now concerning the deſire of procreation, and of-ſpring, as alſo the love of generation, what ſhall I ſay? for in this there is a ſpeciall forme of juſtice. It is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt therefore both theſe, and other vertues to have a neere affinity betweene them. For both fortitude, which either in warre doth preſerve our countrey from the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> or at home doth defend the weake, or our fellowes from robbers is full of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; and to know with what counſell it may defend and helpe, to take alſo the opportunity of time, and place, it is the part of prudence, and modeſty; and temperance it ſelfe without prudence cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what the meane is, cannot know what oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity is; and to give according to meaſure belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to juſtice.

Juſtice ſeemeth to me to be of a higher nature, liberality of a more acceptable. That conſiſteth in cenſure, this in goodneſſe. But the very firſt office it ſelfe of juſtice in the account of the Philoſophers, is excluded with us. For they ſay, that to bee the firſt forme of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice that no man hurt any unleſſe provoked by inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which is made voide by authority of the Goſpell. For the Scripture willeth that the Spirit of the Sonne of man be in us, which came to conferre grace, not to inferre injury.

Therefore the woman-kind was expected to bee an helper, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore according to the will of God, or the conjunction of nature we ought mutually to bee an helpe one to another, to ſtrive in duties, and as it were to place all commodities in the middeſt, and that I may uſe the word of the Scripture <hi>to bring helpe one to another;</hi> either by care or duty, or money, or labours, or ſome way that the grace, and favour of ſociety might bee
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:265:66"/> increaſed betweene us, neither either of us might bee revoked from his office, no not for the terrour of danger, but each of us might account all as his owne, as well adverſity, as proſperity. Furthermore holy <hi>Moſes</hi> feared not to undertake grievous warres for the people, and of-ſpring of his progenitors. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther feared hee the ſtrength of that potent King, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther feares he the fierceneſſe of his barbarous cruelty, but neglected his owne ſafety, that hee might bring liberty to the people. Great therefore is the ſplendor of juſtice, which being borne rather for others, then for her ſelfe doth helpe our community, and ſociety doth hold her highneſſe that ſhee may make all things ſubject to her, that ſhee may bring ayde to others, may beſtow money, may deny no duties, may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take dangerous attempts for others; who would not deſire to hold this towre of vertue, unleſſe avarice as a chiefe obſtacle did weaken, bend, and bring downe the vigour of ſo great a vertue? For while wee deſire to increaſe riches, heape together money, occupie lands with their poſſeſſions, to bee eminent in wealth, wee put off the forme of juſtice, and looſe the name of ſhewing kindneſſe, and bounty, to all without reſpect. For how can he be juſt which ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieth to deprive another that he may enrich himſelfe? The deſire alſo of power doth effeminate the manly forme of juſtice. For how can hee intervene for others which doth indevour to make others ſubject to himſelfe, and how can he ayde him that is weake againſt the mighty, which doth himſelfe affect power that is grievous to liberty?</p>

For there is a great difference, whether one bee taken priſoner in ſome ſore fight, and conflict, or upon ſome former extended grace, or by ſome accident, or chance. For a ſharper revenge is repaid upon ſharper, and more bitter enemies, and upon truce-breakers, and upon them which have more grievouſly hurt: as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample upon the<note n="a" place="margin">Numb. 31.3.17.</note>

And this favour did the Prophet ſhew them that came to take him; For ſo we reade, that the King of <hi>Syria</hi> had ſent his hoſt to beſiege him, becauſe it was told him, that <hi>Eliſha</hi> was he, that diſcloſed all his counſell. <hi>Gehazi</hi> the ſervant of the Prophet ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the army began to feare danger, to whom the Prophet ſaid, <hi>feare not, for there bee more with us then againſt us,</hi> and the Prophet <hi>praying that his eyes might bee opened, they were opened.</hi> Therefore <hi>Gehazi ſaw the whole mountaine round about Eliſha filled wtth horſes, and chariots.</hi> Wherefore to theſe going downe the mountaine the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Let the Lord ſtrike the hoſt of Syria with blindneſſe,</hi> which being obtained, hee ſaid to the <hi>Syrians, come after mee, and I will bring you to the man whom yee ſeeke.</hi> And they ſaw <hi>Eliſha</hi> whom they ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to take, but when they ſaw him, they were not able to lay hold of him.

Of theſe two therefore doth beneficence conſiſt, that it may be perfect. For it is not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent bee willing to'doe well, but alſo it is required
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:265:68"/> that it bee put in execution; Neither againe is it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to doe well in outward performance, unleſſe that doe proceed out of a good fountaine that is out of a good will; <hi>For God loveth a</hi>

                        <hi>cheerefull giver.</hi> For if thou doſt it unwillingly what rewards is there? Whence the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaking generally, <hi>If I doe</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor. 9.17.</note> 
                        <hi>it willingly I ſhall have my reward, if againſt my will the diſpenſation is committed to mee.</hi> In the Goſpell likewiſe wee have many inſtructions for juſt liberality. It is a moſt commendable thing therefore to bee willing to doe well, and to give with that mind to profit, not to hurt. For if thou thinke thou oughteſt to extend thy contribution to a luxurious perſon for the maintenance of his riotouſneſſe, or to an adulterer to nouriſh him in his ſinne, there can bee no beneficence there, where there is no benevolence. For that is not to profit, but to hurt another, if thou give to him that conſpireth againſt his countrie, that deſireth upon thy coſt to gather together the wicked, which may impugne the Church. This is not libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to bee allowed of, if thou helpe him which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees with heavy rebukes againſt the widow and the fatherleſſe, or doth attempt to deprive them forcibly of their poſſeſſions. That bounty is not to bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, if what is given to one is wreſted from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if thou get it unjuſtly, and thinke it ought juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to bee diſpenſed: unleſſe perhaps, as<note n="z" place="margin">Luke 19.</note> 
                        <hi>Zacheus</hi> did, thou reſtore to him fourefold whom thou haſt defrauded, and thou recompence the faults of the dayes of thy Paganiſme with the ſtudy of true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and worke of a beleever. Let thy liberality therefore have a good foundation. This is firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired that thou contribute to the cauſe of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell in faith, that thou uſe no impoſture in thy oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that thou ſay not, thou beſtoweſt more<note n="d" place="margin">With <hi>Ananias,</hi> and <hi>Sapphira.</hi> Acts 5.</note> when thou beſtoweſt leſſe. For what ſhould need ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe? there is fraud in thy promiſe, it is in thy
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:265:69"/> power to give what thou wilt. Deceipt loſeth the foundation, and the world falleth, and commeth to nought. Did <hi>Peter</hi> ſo burne with indignation, that hee was deſirouſ to deſtroy<note n="e" place="margin">Acts 5.</note> 
                        <hi>Ananias</hi> or his wife? But he would others to beware by their example, leſt they running into like offence might periſh with them. Neither is it perfect liberality if thou contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute rather for<note n="f" place="margin">Prov. 25.14.</note> vaine-glory then for mercy ſake, Thy affection impoſeth a name upon thy worke, looke with what mind it proceedeth from thee, ſo is it eſtimated. Thou ſeeſt what a morall judge thou haſt? Hee conſulteth with thee in what ſenſe hee ſhall take thy worke, and hee firſt inquireth how it ſtandeth with thy mind. <hi>Let not thy</hi>

                        <hi>left hand know,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>what thy right hand doth.</hi> Hee ſpeaketh not of the body, but let not thine unanimous friend, nor thy brother know what thou doſt, leſt while here thou ſeekeſt to get a reward by boaſting, thou there loſeſt the fruit of remuneration. But there is perfect liberality where one doth cover his workes with ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and doth ſecretly come as an ayde to every ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall perſon, and whom the mouth of the poore praiſeth, and not his owne lips. Moreover, perfect liberality is commended by the faith of them in whom it is, the cauſe, place, and time, where, and when it is executed: inſomuch that the firſt and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall good worke is that which is done toward them, that are of the<note n="h" place="margin">Gal. 6.10.</note> houſhold of faith: It is an exceeding great fault, if in thy knowledge thou ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the faithfull man to want, and ſuch a one whom thou knoweſt to bee without money in his purſe, to be pinched with famine, and to indure much ſorrow, eſpecially when he is aſhamed to make knowne his poverty: if he ſhall ſpeedily fall into captivity, or that in thy knowledge into reproch, and thou helpe him not, if he being juſt ſuffer impriſonment, or bee under vexation for ſome debt (for although mercy is
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:265:69"/> due to all, yet much to the juſt) if in the time of his affliction he obtaineth nothing of thee, if laſtly in the time of his extreame perill, even then, when he is haled to death thy money prevailes more with thee, then the life of him about to die, it is an exceeding great fault, I ſay, and juſtly condemned. Of this<note n="i" place="margin">Job 29.13.</note> 
                        <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaketh worthily, <hi>the bleſſing of him that was about to periſh came upon me.</hi> The Lord truly is no accepter of perſons, becauſe hee knowes all things. But wee verily owe mercy to all: but becauſe the moſt ſeeke it by deceipt, and counterfeit griefe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore where the cauſe is manifeſt, the perſon knowne, the time urgeth, mercy ought more largely to open her bowels. For the Lord is not covetous, that hee ſhould deſire to receive much of thee, bleſſed truly is he <hi>that</hi>

                        <hi>leaveth all and followeth him.</hi> But he is bleſſed alſo that doth it in what he hath in his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and reſolution, and this is to be habitually benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. The Lord preferred the<note n="l" place="margin">Luke 21.1.</note> widowes two mites before the gifts of the rich, becauſe <hi>ſhee gave all that ſhee had,</hi> but they beſtowed a ſmall part of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance. Wee ſee therefore, while wee compare things together, that the<note n="m" place="margin">2 Cor. 8.10.</note> affection maketh the gift either rich or poore, and ſetteth a higher, or lower prize upon the deeds of men. But God will not riches to be ſpent all at once, and that we ſhould be emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied of our whole ſubſtance, as it were at one lift, and hazard: but to be diſpenſed, and diſpoſed of up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on each occaſion in their ſeverall portions, unleſſe peradventure wee will doe as<note n="n" place="margin">1 Kings 19.21.</note> 
                        <hi>Eliſha</hi> did, who ſlew his oxen, and fed the poore of that which hee had, that he might be deteyned by no houſhold af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, but leaving all addict himſelfe wholly to the ſtudy of prophecy. That liberality alſo is to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of, that thou deſpiſe not the next of thy ſeed, if thou know them to want. For it is better for thee, that thou thy ſelfe helpe thine, in whom ſhame co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth

For the cauſe, not favour or affection muſt over-rule. Neither haſt thou therefore dedicated thy ſelfe to God, that thou migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt inrich thine owne ſtocke, but that as a fruit of thy good workes thou mighteſt attaine to eternall life, and by the<note n="o" place="margin">Prov. 22.9.</note> bleſſing of commiſeration thou migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt have more aſſurance of the<note n="p" place="margin">Dan. 4.24. <hi>juxta ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terem tranſl. redime,</hi> but better <hi>abrumpe</hi> or as much as <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.8. <hi>adjuvet redimere Veheperah</hi> The bookes of the <hi>Talmud</hi> are divided by <hi>perakim</hi> fractions, it were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to ſay redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> redemption of thy ſinnes: They ſuppoſe they require a ſmall matter of thee being a kinſman, but they ſeeke the prize of thy reward, and ſtrive to deprive thee of the fruit of eternall life.

Thou haſt our counſell before, thou requireſt our authority, firſt therefore no man ought to be aſhamed, if of a rich man he be made poore in giving to the poore, becauſe Chriſt being rich was made<note n="q" place="margin">2 Cor. 8.9.</note> poore, that by his poverty he might inrich us. Hee hath given us a rule to follow, that if any man hath removed the famine of the poore, and hath relirved their want, this may be a good ground for the waſting of his patrimony; Whence the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>in this,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I ſpeake not by</hi>

And I ſuppoſe the Apoſtle ſpeakes not of the ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of affection, but of the ſtreightneſſe of allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. But of their perſons, I thinke it to have beene ſpoken, that your abundance may bee for their want, and their abundance for your want: that is to ſay, that the abundance of the people may bee of good operation to relieve their poverty by nouriſhing them, and their abundance ſpirituall may bee of like operation to ſupply among the people the defect of ſpirituall merite, and may bring unto them grace. Whence very ſingular is the preſident which he hath ſet downe out of<note n="x" place="margin">Exod. 16.12. 2 Cor. 8.15.</note> 
                        <hi>Moſes, hee which had much had nothing over, and hee which had little had nothing leſſe.</hi> This worthy example doth well exhort all men to the duty of mercy, becauſe hee which doth
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:265:71"/> poſſeſſe much gold hath nothing over, for that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it in this world is nothing, and he which hath little hath nothing leſſe, becauſe it is nothing which hee loſeth. The matter is without loſſe, which wholly is a losse in itſelfe. ſo alſo is the ſenſe good: otherwiſe hee which hath overplus, although hee give not hath nothing over: becauſe although hee bee a getter, and gainer ſtill, yet deſiring more doth need alwayes. And hee which hath little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caieth not, becauſe it is not much which feedeth, and ſufficeth a poore man. Likewiſe therefore, that poore man that beſtoweth ſpirituall almes in ſtead of moneys, though hee hath a great portion of grace, yet hath nothing over. For the mind is not burde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with grace, or gifts divine, but ſuccoured, and ſupported. The ſacred ſentence may alſo bee thus underſtood: Thou haſt nothing over, O man. For how much is it, that thou haſt received, albeit it may ſeeme to be much in reſpect of thy ſelfe?<note n="y" place="margin">Luke 7.18.</note> 
                        <hi>Iohn,</hi> then whom no man was greater among the ſonnes of men, yet was hee leſſe then hee, which was leaſt in the kingdome of heaven. The ſentence alſo may carry this ſenſe; The grace of God, becauſe it is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall hath nothing over corporally, or to ſupply the wants of the body. For who can comprehend the magnitude, or latitude which hee diſcerneth not? Faith if it ſhall be as a graine of muſtard-ſeed ſhall bee able to tranſlate mountaines out of their places, and there is not given thee, whoſoever thou art, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond one graine of muſtard-ſeed. If grace abound in thee, it is to bee feared leſt thy mind begin to bee lifted up with ſo great a gift. For that there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that have more grievouſly fallen through the height, and pride of their owne heart, then if they had no grace. And hee which hath little doth not diminiſh it: becauſe it is not a bodily thing that it may be divided, and that which ſeemeth to bee little,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:265:71"/> is much to him that wanteth nothing. Age alſo, and debility of body is to bee conſidered in contribution, ſometime alſo modeſty, which ſheweth an ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous nature, and a generous ſtocke: and that thou contribute more to ſuch, as are old, which are not now able to get their living by labour: The ſame conſideration likewiſe is to bee had, where is feeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of body, or want of ſtrength to performe tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile, here our helping hand is to bee lent more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily. Againe, if any one bee fallen from a wealthy eſtate to a needy, and eſpecially, if by no fault of his owne, but either by robbery, or baniſhment, or by the falſe accuſations, or calumnies of the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant hath loſt what ſometime hee had in poſſeſſion. But peradventure ſome man may ſay; The blind ſitteth in one, and the ſame place with the young luſty Springall, the one is neglected, the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected.</p>
                     <p>It is true indeed, becauſe hee creepeth and incro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth through his importunity neerer, and faſter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the well-diſpoſed then the other. But that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth not from want of judgement in him, but that hee may bee rid of a tedious and troubleſome beggar. And the<note n="z" place="margin">Luke 11.8.</note> Lord alſo in the Goſpell ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to give way to ſuch an almes, <hi>when the gates being ſhut, and himſelfe that was deſired in bed, yet upon the importunateneſſe of the craver could doe no leſſe then give, yea, give as much as was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted.</hi>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a faire, and commendable part in thee alſo to bee of a ready, and forward diſpoſition to requite him which hath beſtowed upon thee either a benefit, or a gift, if he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe hath fallen into neceſſity. For what is ſo contrary to duty, as not to render what thou haſt received? Neither doe I thinke it enough to be rendred againe with the like, but in a more abundant meaſure, the uſe of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit is to be caſt up in thine account, that thereby thou maiſt relieve him with lo much, as may eaſe him of his trouble. For not to exceed in requitall of a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, is to be inferiour, becauſe he that conferreth it, is before the receiver in time, before him in curteſie. The nature therefore of the ground is to be imitated of us, which is wont to rcturne the ſeed ſowen in a greater number, and more manifold increaſe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is written<note n="a" place="margin">Prov. 24.30.31.</note> for thine inſtruction, <hi>I paſſed by the field of the ſlothfull, and by the vineyard of the man deſtitute of underſtanding.</hi> If thou ſhalt leave this field, it ſhall be deſolate. A wiſe man therefore is alſo like a tilled field reſtoring the ſeed committed to it, and the talent commended to his truſt in much more meaſure, and with greater advantage. The earth therefore buddeth forth fruits, either of it own accord, or returneth backe thoſe that ſhee is betruſted withall with a fuller hand. Thou oweſt both by a certaine hereditary right to thy parents, leſt thou be left as an unfruitfull field. Howbeit, let it be, that ſome man may excuſe himſelfe in that he hath not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, can any one excuſe himſelfe in that hee hath not
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:265:72"/> reſtored? It is ſcarce lawfull for any one not to give, but altogether unlawfull not to reſtore. Therefore <hi>Salomon</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Prov 23.12.</note> hath worthily ſpoken, <hi>when thou ſitteſt to eate with a ruler, conſider diligently what is ſet before thee, and put the knife to thy throate,</hi> for thou muſt prepare the like. We being deſirous to imitate him have written ſentences. To beſtow a gratuity is good, but to be unmindfull of recompence is harſh. The earth it ſelfe, as hath beene ſaid, ſuggeſteth an example of humanity; It voluntarily miniſtreth fruits, which thou haſt not ſowen, rendreth that multiplied, which it hath received. To deny to tell thee backe thy money lent, it is not lawfull; how then can it be lawfull not to recompence a favour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived? Thou haſt it alſo in the<note n="c" place="margin">Prov. 25.21, 23.</note> Proverbs, that this retribution of good hath prevailed ſo much with God, that in the day of ruine, when the weight of thy ſinnes hath drawne downe the ballance it hath found grace in his ſight.

                        <hi>grace of God I am that I am, I laboured more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly then they all.</hi> One therefore hath repaid the fruit of the received benefit, as gold with gold, ſilver with ſilver, another labour, another (and I know not whether more richly alſo) hath reſtored his affection only: For what if there bee no power yeelded to reſtore? In rendring a benefit the mind doth more worke, then the valuation, the good will is more ponderous, then the poſſibility of returning, and repaying the gift. For in that ſelfe-ſame thing that thankes is returned, requitall is made. Good will therefore is a great matter, which though it beſtow nothing, it doth exhibite, and ſhew forth more: and when in the matter of patrimony it hath nothing, yet doth it extend, and inlarge it ſelfe in intention to more, and this it doth without any its owne loſſe, and with the gaine of all.<note place="margin">The preeminency of benevolence above li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality, isno leſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended afterward in the conſequences, then here.</note> And therefore doth good will excell, and goe beyond liberality it ſelfe: as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing richer in converſation, then that in contribution. For there bee more that ſtand in need of the benefit of benevolence then of liberality, becauſe all living in abundance; need not this: yet is this moſt need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full alſo, the poore being the greater number. But benevolence and liberality are yoked together as companions; but ſo that liberality proceedeth from it, when the uſe of freedome in giving follows the affection of<note n="c" place="margin">Omninò ſunt duo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nera largorum: quorum alteri prodigi. alteri li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berales, Cic. l. <hi>2.</hi> Offic.

Nonnunquam ita eſt ſed hîc ſumitur in bonam partem, nempe pro humanitatis effectu.</note> largeſſe, the one is ſeparated, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided from the other. For when liberality faileth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence remaineth, as the common mother of all, coupling and knitting together friendſhip, faithfull in counſell, pleaſant in proſperity, grieved in adverſity: inaſmuch that every one chooſeth rather to commit himſelfe to the counſell of him which is a well-wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, then of him that is reputed wiſe. As <hi>David</hi> when hee was wiſer, yet had hee his repoſe in the<note n="d" place="margin">Sam. 20.5.24.</note> counſell of <hi>Ionathan</hi> being his junior. Take away
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:265:74"/> benevolence, and put it out of courſe among men, and pull the Sunne out of the firmament; right ſo ſhall it bee, becauſe without it no uſe can bee made of mankind, as to direct the ſtronger in his paſſage, to call backe the wanderer, to give entertainment, and hoſpitality. It was therefore no meane vertue, wherein <hi>Job</hi> did ſo much rejoyce within himſelfe, when hee ſaid,<note n="e" place="margin">Job 31.32.</note> 
                        <hi>the ſtranger did not lodge in the ſtreet, but I opened my doores to him that went by the way.</hi> Without this vertue common curteſie would bee denied, even to give water out of the well, fire and light out of the chimney. Good will therefore in all thoſe is as the fountaine of water re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing the thirſty, and as a light, whereat many kindling their candle, reteyneth ſtill the ſame vertue in it ſelfe, and imparting to others, diminiſheth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of its owne ſtore. There is alſo that liberality in benevolence, that if thou haſt any hand-writing of an unable debtor, when thou haſt cancelled the ſame thou reſtoreſt it him, no paiment at-all being made. This doth holy <hi>Job</hi> admoniſh by his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as a duty that every man ought to performe: whoſe praiſe was in<note n="f" place="margin">Job 29.12.16.</note> giving what was his owne, not in requiring his owne. Hee which hath of his owne doth not borrow, he which hath not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall, cannot diſcharge the obligation. But thou ſaieſt that thou doſt not exact thine owne. Is it not all one when thou reſerveſt the debt for covetous heires? how much better mighteſt thou repreſent with the praiſe of benevolence, and that without loſſe of thy money? But that wee may more fully diſcuſſe the point benevolence proceeding forth firſt from thoſe of our owne family, that is, from our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, parents, brethren, by degrees of conjunction came into walled cities, and going out of <hi>Paradiſe</hi> filled the world.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXXIIII.</hi> Of Fortitude, which without Iuſtice to bee no ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is ſhewed by ſundry inſtances.</head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE have very copiouſly handled in the place of Juſtice the nature, and force of honeſty. Now let us treate of Fortitude, which carrying an higher ſaile then the reſt, is divided into the affaires of warre, and domeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, or thoſe of peace; But the ſtudy of the affaires of warre ſeemeth to be inconvenient to our treatiſe of Office, becauſe we intend to ſet out the dutyes of the mind, rather then of the body, neither have wee now to intermeddle with the noiſe of armes, but with the conditions of peace. But our anceſtors, ſuch as were <hi>Ioſhuah, Gideon, Sampſon, David,</hi> have had alſo great renowne in affaires of warre. Fortitude therefore is reputed a vertue of an higher ſtraine then the reſt: yet ſuch as goes not alone, nor unaccompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied. For it commits not it ſelfe to it ſelfe; for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out juſtice it is the fuell, and matter of iniquitie. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by how much more ſtrong it is, by ſo much more ready is it to oppreſſe an inferiour. And in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of warre it ſelfe, this is firſt to bee looked into, whether it be juſtly, or unjuſtly undertaken? <hi>David</hi> never waged it, but being provoked. Therefore in all his warres he had prudence, as a companion. Wherefore being to fight with <hi>Goliah,</hi> one of the breed of the Gyants, and of huge bigneſſe, in a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle combate, hee refuſed ſuch weapons, as might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comber him. For his ſtrength lay rather in his owne armes, then in ſtrange armour of defence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was not acquainted. Againe, he choſe rather to encounter him a-farre off, that his ſtroke might
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:265:76"/> make the deeper impreſſion: and with a ſtone out of a ſling ſlew him. Afterward, never did hee enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe any warres, but firſt conſulted with the oracles of God. Therefore departed he in alll, Maſter of the field, even unto his extreame old age continued he prompt in the feats of armes, making warre amiddeſt the fierce troupes of the Gyants, not for the deſire he had of his owne, but of Gods glory in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and then too, when careleſſe of his life, was he, as a good ſouldier preſerved. But this fortitude of his, is not only of renowne, but theirs alſo is moſt glorious, who in the greatneſſe of their mind <hi>through</hi>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Herefore fortitude, of the minde is no meane vertue ſeparated from the reſt, as waging warre with the other vertues, but that which only defendeth the luſtre and beauty of them all, keepeth iudgement, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeth againſt all vices with an inexpiable hatred, and contention. Invincible is it in labours, couragious in dangers, and contrariwiſe rigide and ſtiffe againſt pleaſures thats hard and piouſly obſtinate againſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements to evill, knowing no ſuch, nor can bee brought to know how, or what it meaneth to lend an eare to the inticements of ſinners: no <hi>not bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> ſuch according to the prohibiton of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle<note n="a" place="margin">2 Iohn 5.10.

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:265:81"/> of coveteouſneſſe. For there is nothing ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to fortitude as to bee overcome with lucre, while the warrier with his forces is too greedy vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the ſpoiles of the ſlaine, oftentimes the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies repulſed, and their whole army inclining to flight miſerably falleth, and whiles occupied in ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling, the legions remaine deiected amiddeſt their triumphsrthey prick forward the adverſaries, who were fled before to returne vpon their backes. Let fortitude therefore repell, and tread vnder foote ſo cruell a beaſt as is greedy avarice, neither let it be enſnared with covetous deſires nor disheartned with feare, becauſe vertue is of ſuch ſtability in it ſelfe, that it purſues and puts to flight all vices, as its poi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon, &amp; bane. Aboue all it maketh choiſe to enter the liſts of a diuell, and ſingle fight with anger, and to make her ſhew her backe, becauſe ſhee it is that ſtrippeth of counſell, corrupteth, fouleth and filleth the bloud with pernicious humors in ſuch ſort, that ſhee would be avoided, as a ſickneſſe, and noiſome diſeaſe that moſt of all hurteth. Let it beware al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the hunting and gaping after glorie, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which often deſtroyeth, when it is immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately ſought, but alwaies vndoubtedly when it is uſurped: were any of theſe partes of fortitude in vertue, defectiue in <hi>Iob,</hi> did any of theſe in vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe creep vpon him? how did he tollerate the anguiſh of feſtering, and raging ſores, ſcattered throughout his whole body, and beſide the paine, and pinching of ſickneſſe, cold, and famine, how deſpiſed he the perill of his life? Was there any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acervation of riches by rapines found in his ſo great abundance of contribution to the poore? Did his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varice ſtirre him vp to the purchaſing, and procuring of great rents, and revenues, did it incite him to the following of his pleaſures and delights? Did the iniurious contention of theſe three<note n="b" place="margin">Iob 2.7.</note> Kings his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:265:81"/> friends, or the contumely of his ſervants move him to anger? Did his honour lift him up to lightneſſe, when hee<note n="c" place="margin">Iob 33.33.</note> imprecated grievous things againſt himſelfe, if at any time he had concealed the leaſt fault committed, though contray to his will, or feared to have it<note n="d" place="margin">Ibid. v. <hi>36.</hi>

                     <p>To conclude, King <hi>Antiochus</hi> who came armed with an hundred thouſand footmen, and two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand horſemen, and thirty two<note n="m" place="margin">1 Maccab. 6.30.</note> Elephants, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that at the<note n="n" place="margin">Verſ. 39.</note> Sunne ſhining upon the armour, and golden ſhields throughout the ſeverall beaſts, the mountaines gliſtered therewith, and gave light as lampes of fire, was terrified with the valour of one, and brought to demaund conditions of peace.

For the one of theſe is ſubtilty, the other vanity. Let no man deſpiſe the judgement of any man, eſpecially what the beſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected conceive of him. For by this meanes he lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to bring due reverence to the good, whom to neglect is arrogancy, or diſſoluteneſſe: of which two
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:265:89"/> one proceeds from pride, the other from neglect. Let him alſo that will bee of comely carriage take heed to the motions of his mind. For hee muſt be circumſpect, and beare a watchfull eye over his owne wayes, both in ſhunning what evill may bee againſt him, as alſo in providing what may make for his owne ſafety. For there be certaine motions, among the which there is that appetite, which breaketh forth after a violent manner, where in Greeke it is called <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, becauſe it ſuddenly flyeth out with much force, faſt, and farre increaſeth, and ſpreadeth abroad. In theſe motions the powers of the mind, and of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are not of meane ſtrength, which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding are double: ſome placed in the appetite, ſome in the reaſon, which able part may bridle the appetite, and make it obſequious to her, may lead it whither ſhee will, and by an officious dominion may teach it what ought to be done, what to bee avoided, that thus obedience may bee yeelded to ſo good a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe. For wee ought to be ſollicitous, and vigilant, that wee doe nothing raſhly, and without care, or ought at all, whereof wee are not able to render a profitable reaſon. For the cauſe of our action, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit it be not rendred to of all men: yet it is exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of all men. Neither have wee truly wherein wee may excuſe our ſelves. For although there be a certaine power of nature in every appetite, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding in the law of nature it ſelfe, the ſame appetite is ſubject to reaſon, and it doth likewiſe obey the ſame. Wherefore it is the part of a good watchman, ſo to forecaſt in his mind, that appetite doth neither runne before, neither forſake reaſon: leſt in running before, it moleſt her, ſo that ſhee be excluded, and againe leſt in forſaking her, there be a failing. Moleſtation taketh away conſtancy, failing diſcovereth idleneſſe, accuſeth of lazineſſe. For the mind being troubled the appetite ſwelleth greater,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:265:90"/> ſpreadeth out longer and wider, and in its unbridled and impetuous race receiveth not the raine of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, neither feeleth any, either hand, or curbe of the rider to guide, and reſtraine it. Whence it common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happeneth, not only while the mind is troubled, and turmoiled, that reaſon is ſhaken off, and loſt, but alſo the countenance inflamed, either with anger or luſt, doth waxe pale with feare, doth not containe it ſelfe within the bounds of moderate pleaſure, but is taken with ſo much delight, and ſolace, as is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible.

For it is a fit place vnder the part of temperance to ſhew how anger may be ſuppreſſed.

Theſe becauſe they cannot have iuſtice, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded with ſhame, ſorely perplexed with griefe. Like to theſe are very many of my ranke, and of my coate. For if any offer me iniury a weak &amp;, ſilly man, though I be weake, and vnable to beare it:<note place="margin">1.

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:265:91"/> my peace, and replie nothing at all. But if I be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect (that is to ſay, if I may ſo ſpeak, ſeing in truth I am weake) then I bleſſe them that curſe mee, as <hi>Paul</hi> alſo did bleſſe, when he ſaith, <hi>being evill ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi>

Moreover it grieved him not to be reviled, yea, when it befell him, he imbraced it with much deſire becauſe it moved him more earneſtly to ſeeke for mercy at the hands of God. But ſee how he ſtored vp humility, iuſtice, and prudence in his heart, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to get favour of God. Firſt he ſaith, Therefore <hi>he curſeth me becauſe the Lord</hi>

For if we can be contented to ſuffer greivous things at the handes of our owne, why doe we take it in evill part, when ſtrangers bring them vpon vs? Thirdly he ſaith, <hi>let him alone, let him curſe becauſe the Lord it may be hath therefore bidden him that he might ſee mine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, and humiliation, &amp; doe me good for his cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this day.</hi> Neither did he ſuffer him onely to rayle, but to follow him <hi>by the ſide of the mountaine, and caſt ſtones at him,</hi> Yea, which is more, after the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:265:91"/> victory obtained, he willingly remitted the offence which I have therefore inſerted, that I might teach holy <hi>David</hi> being a man of an Evangelicall ſpirit not only to have taken none offence at him, but his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to him to have beene welcome, and to have brought him grace, and therefore to have beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted, not exaſperated with theſe his malicious and miſchievous deſpights: as being more advantageous to him in the more certaine expectation of a more am<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple reward of the bountiful Recompencer of all pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent forbearance. But howbeit he had now proceeded farre in the way of perfection, notwithſtanding hee ſought to attain to it in a higher degree.

For what is it to ſcrape together riches but a vaine thing, and nothing furthering the ſoules welfare? For hee that ſhall dive into it ſhall hee not find too much vanity in it, ſo much ſo greedily with ſuch an hungry and unſatiable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite to gape after this fading, ſoone vaniſhing, and periſhing pelfe? When thou haſt with continuall carking, and caring raked it together, how knoweſt thou, whether God will ſuffer thee to poſſeſſe it one moment? Is it not a vaine thing for the merchant,

Being out of hope of any better ſeaſon to ſet up ſaile, and make his returne, how patient is hee of delay, leſt gaping for gaine hee ſhould make ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke? Is hee not alſo vainly troubled, which hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth together with long hard labour a great deale of mucke, when he hath no heire at all to leave it unto? It oftentimes falleth out, that what a covetous man hath gathered together with much care, a luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and prodigal heire doth incontinently by a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious, and braine-ſicke courſe make havocke of what hath beene a long time in getting, being a foule devourer, blindly led to the preſent benefit, and ſweet repoſe, unprovident for the after good, ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth up all with open mouth like a gulfe even at one bit.

It may ſeeme to bee wondred at that he confuteth not ſuch reproches,<note n="c" place="margin">Luke 23.9.</note> &amp; falſe accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations. A iuſt apologie maketh all whole whatſoeuer can be ſpoken to impeach our credite, taciturnity is taken for a conſent, becauſe it ſeemeth to confirme what is obiected, when that is not anſwered which is ſought after. Doth the Lord therefore confirme by his ſilence the accuſation, or doth he not rather in not refelling it, deſpiſe it? For he doth well to hold his peace, who needeth no defence. Let him labour for a defence who feareth to be overcome let him haſten to ſpeake, who ſtandeth in awe of the victorie. But Chriſt is condemned, and yet doth overcome, is iudged, and yet not brought vnder
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:265:102"/> by the power thereof: as the Prophet witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, <hi>that thou mighteſt be juſtified in thy ſayings,</hi>

                        <hi>and cleere when thou art judged.</hi> The cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is better, which is not defended, and yet is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, that juſtice is fuller, and firmer, which is not held vp with words, but ſupported with the truth. The tongue muſt needs be ſilent, when equitie it ſelfe is preſent to ſuccour it. The force whereof was ſo prevalent with <hi>Pilat,</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Mat. 27.24.</note> that it made him cry out, <hi>I am innocent from the bloud of this juſt man.</hi> A bad cauſe is holpen forward by the tongue, a good needs it not, men had accuſtomed that courſe, Chriſt would none of it. Should juſtice ſo be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronaged as is iniquity? Colour, and excuſe muſt of neceſſity thruſt in here, otherwiſe there is no han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out, whereas there the naked truth is enough. Wherefore in that Chriſt gained the cauſe againſt <hi>Pilate,</hi> it was not out of his oratory, though <hi>never man ſpake as this man ſpake,</hi> but out of his vertue. Can we think the Saviour of the world, who is ſapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence it ſelfe, knew not the way to overcome? Not anſwering again he knew to be it, &amp; therefore he had rather his cauſe to approue it ſelfe, then to ſpeake in it. And what ſhould mooue him to ſpeake, when as his ſilence was ſufficient to ſtoppe the mouthes of his adverſaries? But peradventure the feare of loſing the opportunity of ſaving mankind, vnleſſe we ſhall make that the whole cauſe of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious triumph, brought him to it. For he neglected his owne ſalvation that he might ſaue vs, hee ſpared not his owne ſo precious a perſon, that the benefit thereof might ſpread to all his people, he choſe to be overcome himſelfe, that he might overcome in whatſoever ſtood againſt vs.</p>

And therefore as the ſunne when it ariſeth, hideth the globe of the moone, and the other lights of the ſtarres, ſo the brightnes of honeſty, when it ſhineth and gliſtereth in its true, and perfect comelineſſe, ſhadoweth, and obſcureth the other good things which according to the eſtimate of bodily pleaſure in the worlds account, are deemed famous, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned.

And for that cauſe he who would open the kingdome of heaven to all, did not ſeek what was profitable for himſelfe, but what was profitable for all men. Therefore wee muſt likewiſe derive a certaine order, and degree from things vſuall, and common to thoſe that are
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:265:119"/> moſt eminent, and of excellent note, that out of more ſpecialties we may the better collect, what is the progreſſe, and proceeding of this one of vtility. And firſt we ſhall know that there is nothing ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable as to be loved, nothing ſo vnprofitable as not to be loved. For to be hated, I hold to bee a deadly and capitall euill, and much worſe then death it ſelfe. Wherefore let vs doe this, that we ſeeke with all ſedulity to maintaine our credite, and good opinion, and firſt that vpon the meeknes of our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and gentleneſſe of mind, we wiſely wind our ſelues into the affections of men. For good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is popular, and acceptable to all, and there is nothing that doth more eaſily ſlippe, and in a pious manner more readily inſinuato it ſelfe into humane ſenſes. This if it be holpen with manſuetude of manners, facilitie of mind, moderation of commands, affabilitie of ſpeech, with the due weight of words, and a patient commutation of them, where there ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth any harſhneſſe together with the grace of modeſty interpoſed, it is incredible how much it ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vantageth to the accumulating of love. For wee read not only in private perſons, but alſo in Kings themſelues, how much the facility of faire affability hath profited, and the pride, and ſwelling tumor of boiſterous words hath hindred, yea, hath demoliſhed their kingdomes themſelves, diſſolved, and diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vtterly their whole power, and regall authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Now if any one by his counſell, by his neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie vſe, and ſervice, by his officious, yet faithfull performance of needfull duties get popular grace, if any one make offer to vndergoe daunger in his owne perſon for all the peoples good, there is no doubt to be made of it, but that ſuch loue will bee rendred him backe againe at their hands, that they will preferre his welfare, and credite before their owne.

In like ſort alſo fidelity is the way to procure love, in ſo much that hee, who hath made in ſome certaine affaires faithfull performance to one, or two, may iſſue in thereby by little, and little into the hearts of many, and grow, and flow in further untill with full ſea, at the laſt it doth get the grace, and countenance of all.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F ſo be that it be a laudable thing to carry a ſober mind in reſpect of riches: how much better is it to get the love of the people by libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality? neither by that which is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous, where is importuni y, neither by that which is too ſtreight where is indigency, and want. But there bee many kinds of liberality, neither only toward them who in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:265:129"/> the diſpoſing, and diſpenſing of almes for the ſuſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of life need daily reliefe: but alſo toward the ſuſtenance of thoſe, and providing for them, who are aſhamed to make their need publickly knowne, that is to ſay, ſo farre forth as the common proviſion for the poore bee not thereby exhauſted. For I ſpeake of the neceſſity, which may fall upon him, that beareth rule in ſome office, as in the office of the miniſtery, all diſpenſatorſhip, that intimation bee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Biſhop, and not concealed, but that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made knowne, proviſion bee appointed for ſuch as are in neceſſity: eſpecially if it come not by effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and riotous waſtfulneſſe in the time of youth, but by ſome oppreſſion, or loſſe, poverty, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe caſt upon him by the hand of God, ſo that hee is not able to ſuſtaine the ordinary charges that muſt needs be had for himſelfe, and family. It is great li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality likewiſe to redeeme the captives, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them out of the hands of their enemies, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve from death, and eſpecially women from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filement, to reſtore children to their parents being ſtolne, or otherwiſe taken from them; and againe, parents to their children being under impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and citizens to their countrey. Theſe things are too well knowne in the ſpoiling of<note n="a" place="margin">Sclavonie.</note>

                        </note> how many were there captives in all places of the world ſet to ſale, and what price was made of them, being no more in number then would fill one province? There were ſome notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that would call them backe againe into cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, that were redeemed by the Churches, theſe were more grievous to the poore bondmen, then the bondage, and thraldome it ſelfe; as who did envie the very mercy extended toward them by others. Themſelves if they had fallen into captivity, would ſtand upon this, that they ought to ſerve not as ſlaves, but as freemen; if they had beene ſold, then not to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:265:129"/> deny the miniſtery of ſervitude: and will they cut off power from others to ſet them free, who have no power in themſelves to take off their owne ſervitude, unleſſe perhaps it might pleaſe the buyer to receive a boone, whereby notwithſtanding ſervitude is not taken off, but redemption accepted. Therefore it is a chiefe part of liberality to redeeme captives, eſpecially out of the hands of a barbarous enemy, which is devoide of all mercy, and humanity, unleſſe what the price of redemption hath wrought upon his greedy covetouſneſſe: to undergoe the pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of another mans debt, if the borrower bee not able: to nouriſh young infants deſtitute of food: to defend poore orphans deprived of their parents. There be ſome alſo, which for the cauſe of preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the chaſtity of virgins bereft of their parents, doe place them in Matrimony, neither doe helpe them forward alone with their care, and indevour, but are contented alſo to be at coſt with them, in the disburſing moneys for their preferment. There is a kind of liberality likewiſe taught by the Apoſtle<note n="b" place="margin">1 Tim. 5.16.</note> 
                        <hi>If any faithfull man, or faithfull woman hath wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, let him miniſter unto them, and let not the Church be charged, that there may bee ſufficient for thoſe that are widowes indeed.</hi> Therefore ſuch libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality is profitable, but not common to all. There be alſo very many good men, which have a thinne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venew, and are contented with a little for their uſe, but not enough to adminiſter to others to eaſe them of the burthen of their povertie. Notwithſtanding there is another kind of beneficence, which may ſerve for theſe to helpe their inferiours; For there is a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble liberality, there is one kind, which yeeldeth ayde by the ſupply of money; another, which is beſtowed in adminiſtring helpes of aſſiſtance, which often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is of much more fame and regard. With how much more reputation did <hi>Abraham</hi> receive againe
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:265:130"/> his<note n="d" place="margin">See Gen. chap. 21.</note> nephew recovering him by victorious armes, then if he had redeemed him? How much more acceptably did holy <hi>Ioſeph</hi> gratifie <hi>Pharaoh</hi> the king by his provident counſell, then if he had preſented him with a wedge of gold? The ſale of one of his beſt cities, nay of many of them, would not have procured the ſupply of victuals for one yeare, when the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> did all <hi>Egypt</hi> for the ſpace of five yeares. Money may bee eaſily conſumed, counſell can never be drawne drie. Counſell is increaſed by uſe, money is diminiſhed, quickly faileth, leaveth deſtitute the bountifull minded: ſo that by how much more thy affection is to beſtow upon many, by ſo much leſſe ſhall thy power be to helpe a leſſer<note n="e" place="margin">Which are in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme neceſſity.</note> number, and often ſtand in need of that, which thou thoughteſt to contribute to others. But the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of counſell, and labour, the further it is exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and diffuſed, the more largely doth it abound, and in ſuch manner, that overflowing, it returneth backe againe to his owne fountaine whence it ſprang forth. For the plenty of prudence floweth backe upon it owne ſelfe, and in that it hath copiouſly flowne out to many, all that remaineth is kept in much more ure, and exerciſe.</p>

No where ſhall one find more eagerneſſe in their over-greedy deſires, then here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong this ſort of<note n="a" place="margin">Prov. 28.3.</note> people. The ſtout, and ſturdy impudently intrude themſelves, having no other cauſe to crave an almes, then that they may wander from place to place, in a lawleſſe, looſe, and licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous kind of liberty; and what is that they ſo much ſeeke, and labour for, but to deprive the poore of their appointed food, to ſucke away by ſubtilty, and violence, that proviſion ordained only for them? neither contented with a little they covet for more, hold out ſtill the round skirts of their garments,<note n="b" place="margin">Et natalium ſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione licitantes incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta quoeſtuum.</note> and under colour of ſome birth-dayes ſolemnities, they make ſale of their vailes at the higheſt rate. Hee which is eaſily induced to give credite to theſe, ſhall eaſily exhauſt at once the poore mans boxe, and through his ſcant meaſure of allowance, leave him nothing for his reliefe hereafter. Let a moderation be kept in giving, that thoſe ſtrong vagrants bee not ſent away altogether empty, and that the livelihood of the poore be not turned over to the ſpoile of the fraudulent. Let that therefore be the meaſure, that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:265:131"/> humanity be not forgotten, nor neceſſity left deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute. Many pretend themſelves to bee in debt, let the caſe be throughly examined; Many complaine they were robbed by theeves. Either let the injury done to them, or ſome knowledge of their perſon be made appeare to us, that ſo we may more readily yeeld them our helpe. Wee are to disburſe, if they have not to maintaine themſelves, what is fit toward them, that are baniſhed from the Church. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when moderation is obſerved, the dealer abroad of almes, cannot be ſaid to be avariciouſly given, and hard laced to any, but large, and open-handed to all. For we ought not to lay open our eares only to all complaints, but our eyes alſo to the conſideration of their neceſſities, for thereafter are they to bee regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that ſeeke benevolence. Debility, and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe cries lowder to the well diſpoſed, and willing to doe a worke of charity, then the voice. Neither can it bee avoided, but that ſometimes an importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate outcrie muſt needs extort more, but place muſt not be yeelded alwayes to ſuch imprudencie. Hee is to be ſought for, that ſeeth thee not, hee is to be called forth, that bluſheth to come abroad to beg in publick. He that is ſhut up in cloſe priſon, let him be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred of thee in thy compaſſion, let him that is diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſmite thy mind, and affections, with griefe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him whoſe crie cannot come to thine eares, the low dungeon, and depth of his miſery, though it ſwallow up his clamour, yet let it not bury thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion. The people the more they ſee thee devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to charity, more chary will they bee of thy cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, more charitable, and loving in their affections. I know many of the miniſtery, who the more charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they have beene, the more hath their ſtore over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed: becauſe whoſoever ſeeth one of them this way well addicted, he is beneficiall to him, that he in his office may have to diſpence, nothing doubting, but
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:265:131"/> that hereby his owne mercy ſo extended may come to the poore. For no man in whatſoever collation, and contribution intendeth otherwiſe, but that what he doth may be profitable to the poore. If hee ſhall perceive any one to be too immoderate, or too tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious a diſpenſer, that is diſſipating, and making ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocke by erogations, and diſtributions, unneceſſary and ſuperfluous, or pocketing, and purſing up to his owne proper and peculiar uſe, the fruits of other mens labours, he much diſdaineth, and deſpiſeth him. As therefore a mediocrity is to be kept in liberality: ſo for the moſt part a<note n="c" place="margin">But this ſpurre is to be uſed, as the horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man doth, namely, as occaſion ſhall be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> ſpurre is to be put to it.

And veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thou haddeſt gold that thou mighteſt give almes. Why are ſo many captives ſold for ſlaves, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed? Why are ſo many ſlaine by the enemy? It had beene better that thou haddeſt kept the veſſels of the living, then of the mettals. For theſe no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer could bee made. For what mighteſt thou ſay for them? Wouldeſt thou ſay, I feared leſt orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be wanting to the houſe of God? It would bee replied, the Sacraments, which are not bought with gold, ſeeke not, neither doe they delight in it. The ornament of the Sacraments is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the captives. And they are truly preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous veſſels, which doe redeeme the ſoules from death. That is the true treaſure of the Lord, which worketh that which his bloud hath wrought. Then I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the veſſell of the Lords bloud, when I ſhall ſee

How goodly a thing it is, that when the multitude of the captives are redeemed by the Church, it may be ſaid of them, theſe hath Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed. Behold, where is the tried gold, behold where is the gold well approved of, and profitable? Behold the gold of Chriſt which ſaveth from death; behold the gold whereby ſhamefaſtneſſe is redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med from pollution, chaſtity is preſerved from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filement. Theſe children therefore doe I make choice of rather to ſet at liberty, and deliver over to you, then to reſerve, and keepe in ſtore the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined plate of gold. This company of captives, this ranke of inthralled bondmen, is better then the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and bravery of Chalices. The gold of the Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ought to profit this ſort of forlorne, and wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched ſoules, and to free them from ſlaviſh ſervitude. I acknowledge the bloud of Chriſt infuſed into this gold, not only to have gliſtered moſt brightly, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by the gift of redemption to have ingraven in them the vertue of divine operation. Such gold the holy Martyr St. <hi>Laurence</hi> reſerved for the Lord, of whom when the treaſures of the Church were ſought for by the enemy, and he promiſing to ſhew them, brought out the next day the poore to him.

Whether was it ſaid to this Martyr <hi>Laurence,</hi> thou oughteſt not to giue away the treaſures of the Church thou oughteſt not to ſell the veſſels of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in time of neceſſitie for the benefit of the poore? It is needfull that a man faithfully, and with a good conſcience, circumſpectly, and wiſely fulfill this our office. Surely, if one convert goods of the Church to his owne profit it is a fault, but if he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it out to the poore, or redeeme a captive with it, it is mercy. For no man can finde fault, and ſay, why doth the poore live? No man can challenge vs for this, that the captives are redeemed. No man can accuſe vs for that we build the Temple of God. No man may juſtly be angry with vs, becauſe wee open the ground and bury the dead: no man may juſtly grieve, that at the interring of Chriſtians there is a<note n="g" place="margin">Solemnitie of prayer at the buriall of the dead, allowed.</note> ſolemnitie of prayer and thankeſgiving.

                     <p>Remember how often wee in our owne perſon, have endured for the preſervation of what hath been taken by us into the cuſtody of the Church in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of the Widdowes, Orphanes, and other the faithfull, many and bitter conflicts, fearefull and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible aſſaults at the hands of the <hi>Caeſars</hi> themſelues.

For there he calling for it, which chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged it by a reſcript from the Emperour, the Clerkes were contemned, and ſleighted, the honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable perſons that interceded, told them, that no meanes were left them to withſtand the Imperiall command. The forme of the reſcript was read, the Regiſter of the Office was preſent, and to vſe no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger circumſtance, what was depoſed, was granted to be delivered: Notwithſtanding the holy Biſhop of the Church conſulting, one compaſſed about, and ſtrongly fenced that part where he knew the Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes portion, being tranſlated, remained. Whence when it could not bee taken away by violence, it was
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:265:147"/> received vnder hand-writing, and afterward by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the ſame hand-writing was required againe by earneſt petition. The Emperour renewed his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date, that thereby hee might convent us perſonally before him, which being denyed him, the authoritie of the Law of God, the record of the whole courſe of holy writ, and the perill by intermedling this way whereinto <hi>Heliodorus</hi> fell, alledged for it; the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour hardly at the laſt upon much ſupplication tooke this for an anſwer: Yet ſo, that after this the Adverſary againe attempted a new way to pull it from the Church, but that the holy Biſhop preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, by reſtoring what he had received to the Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. In the meane time the faith of the Church is at ſafe anchor, oppreſſion is not feared, becauſe now the matter and ſubſtance it ſelfe on their part, not truſt, and faithfull dealing on our part, is in danger.</p>

That if hee hurt any man, hee doth violate na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, neither gaine ſo much profit by it to himſelfe, as diſadvantage. For what wound can bee heavier then that of the inner conſcience? What is more ſevere then a domeſticall judge, by which every one is found guilty to himſelfe, and doth reprove his owne hart, as having unworthily wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his brother? Which the Scripture<note n="a" place="margin">Prov. 9.7, 8.</note> doth in no ſmall meaſure condemne, ſaying, <hi>out of the mouth of fooles is the ſtaffe of contumelie.</hi> Therefore he is convinced of follie that doth uſe reproch. Is not this more to be avoided then death, then loſſe, then poverty, baniſhment, the griefe of debility? Who doth not account an infirmity of the body, or a loſſe of patrimony a leſſe evill then the infirmity of the mind, or loſſe of credite? It is manifeſt therefore that the ſame ought to be deſired, and retained of all which bringeth the ſame utility to every one in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, which it doth to all in generall, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ought to bee judged profitable, but that which groweth unto a common benefit. For how can that be for the commodity of one, which is for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodity of all? Verily, he which is unprofitable
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:265:159"/> to all, ſeemeth to me not poſſibly to bee able to be profitable to himſelfe. For if there bee one law of nature to all, there is one, and the ſame utility uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally reaching to all. For if there be one law of the univerſe we are bound by the law of nature to provide alſo for it. Wherefore it is not his part which would according to the law of nature pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for another, contrary to that law to hurt him. For if they which runne in a race are for their better information ſo inſtructed before hand, that no man preſumeth to ſupplant, and ſubvert his fellow, but every one ſtriveth with all his power, and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver properation to obtaine the victory: how much more then in this our combat to gaine a better victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſhould wee abſtaine from all fraude, and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention? Some put here a <hi>quaere,</hi> whether if a wiſe man be in danger of ſhipwracke, hee may without injury extort from an unwiſe man his boord, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon relyeth his hopefull evaſion, and ſo to ſave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, deprive him of his life? Albeit it may ſeeme better to me in reſpect of the common good for a wiſe man then for a foole to eſcape ſhipwracke, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it ſeemeth that a juſt, and wiſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ought not to ſeeke to preſerve his life by the death of another, as being ſuch a one, who when hee falleth into the hands of one armed, and being ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken may not ſtrike againe, leſt while hee ſavegardeth his perſon, he contaminateth his piety.

                     <p>To let paſſe the idle imagination of the vertue of a ring, we are able out of the records of the Scripture to ſhew, that a wiſe man underſtanding (if hee once gave admiſſion to ſinne, that he might both lie hid, and raigne as a king, but contrariwiſe perceiving the danger of his life, if he declined the ſame; yet muſt chooſe rather the perill of his life to bee freed from the wickedneſſe, then the wickedneſſe to get him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a kingdome.

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:265:161"/> alone might have effected this, that he might have bin ſeene, and yet not ſlaine of him. But becauſe for the preſervation of his life hee ſuffered himſelfe not to ſinne, neither could beare an others offence, thereby he procured his owne death.

Moreover, the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of corne, wee are to impart to them, let them make good to us by way of commutation, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, according to the worth thereof in gold. Is it ſo I pray you, that theſe being ſent away, others muſt be bought with our money to till our grounds, how much cheaper therefore is it for us to feed theſe, then to buy others, and feed them alſo? Where maiſt thou find to furniſh, and fill up their places with the like? where canſt thou procure whom thou maiſt thus conforme to thy will, ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, bring to thy hand, keepe under obedience, make benefit of, as thou doſt of theſe?

For ſo a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venew

Now in thus determining this holy Senior in his ſage wiſdome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed not the ſtocke of the city, yet ſubminiſtred victuall ſufficient for the ſtranger. How laudable therefore was this his ſervice to men, but how much more acceptable to God<note n="f" place="margin">Deutr. 10.18,</note> who loveth the ſtranger, and giveth him food, and raiment? This great man deſerveth great loue, true approbation, and ſhewing him the people of the whole Province might truly ſay to the Emperour, All theſe have I reſerved for thee, theſe live by the benefit of thy Senate, thoſe this thy Court hath delivered from death: How much more beneficiall was this to the Common-weale, then that which was laſt of all concluded at <hi>Rome</hi> upon the like occaſion, where the ſtrangers were caſt out of the famous city, and all of them, with their children compelled to depart with wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping eyes? Though they had ſpent the greater part of their dayes there, and that with the good liking of the citizens, though they deplored no leſſe their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected baniſhment, ſuddenly interrupted friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, violated affinity, then if they had beene natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally borne inhabitants, yet could no mitigation of the rigour take place, but they muſt be gone. No reaſon could be yeelded for it, but that the old faſhion, and fancy of the vulgar muſt runne its courſe. Yet ſee the event contrary to their expectation, the fecundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the yeare ſo favoured, that the city ſolely wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the importation of graine; and the people of <hi>Italie</hi> living abroad in the countrie, whoſe children they had expelled, might have holpen them in with it, which now they had juſt cauſe to be unwilling to doe. Nothing is more odious, and unadviſed then this, firſt to exclude ſuch as alienated, and eſtranged from their condition, without whom their eſtate can in no wiſe ſubſiſt, and then afterward to expect, and exact duty, and obſervance at their hands. Why doſt
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:265:166"/> thou labour to caſt him out, who hath of his owne proviſion to feed himſelfe? Nay, why doſt thou ſeek to caſt him out, who feedeth thee? With what countenance canſt thou reteine him as thy ſervant, whoſe parents thou ſtriveſt to extrude, and throw out of dores? Doſt thou partake of his wheate, and not impart to him thine affection? with what face doſt thou there extort maintenance, where thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torteſt unkindneſſe? How miſhapen a monſter is this, and how fruitleſſe a birth? For how can that bee fruitfull, or any way profitable which is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, which is not honeſt?</p>
                     <p>And in truth how much ayde did <hi>Rome</hi> then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud her ſelfe of, by depriving ſtrangers of her ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation? Shee might have kept them and eſcaped the famine. For ſo her hope of proviſion had beene no longer deferred then the opportunity of the winds had fitted the Sailers to bring in their ſhips. To have dealt kindly therefore, and indured forrainers, had beene no leſſe honeſt, and profitable for her, then was that done by the wiſe Senior. Therein alſo had decency beene united to honeſty. For by the colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the rich (which had beene done by the weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy among the forreiners through the exchange of moneys for graine) to helpe the needy, to adminiſter food to the hungry, and to ſuffer none to want, is ſuch honeſty, and decency as none can bee greater. The tillers of the fields to have retained their places, thoſe borne in the countrie not to have beene removed, and rooted out, had beene ſo much benefit for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke good as nothing more. Wherefore what is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt is profitable, and what is profitable is likewiſe honeſt.

How may it be convenient here for me, to handle the delicious ſeceſſe for ſolace at <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> and therein the pregnant plot of the <hi>Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian?</hi> who when he had lighted vpon a certaine ſtranger, ſtrangely tranſported with the loue of ſome dainty gardens ſweetneſſe, invited him to a banquet in one of his owne, which he had laboured a long time to vent, eſpecially to ſuch a good chapman that would ſpare no coſt for a choiſe ſolitary walke. Their meeting was appointed to be the next day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, when in the aſſigned place there was a ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet exquiſitely furniſhed with great plenty of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, and in proſpect of the gueſts a multitude of fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ermen ſtanding in a comely order: every one what he had taken, ſtrived how he might firſt offer it vp as a preſent, inſomuch that the table was full fraught
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:265:171"/> and the leaping of the fiſhes troubled the eyes of <hi>them that were ſate downe.</hi> Wherevpon the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger began to wonder thereat and to behold there ſo many boats: and demanding a reaſon it was told him, that it was a day of irrigation,<note n="d" place="margin">Aquationem illic eſſe.</note> and the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe of the waters brought in, made innumerable fiſhes to frequent them. To wind vp all in a word the <hi>Sicilian</hi> wit was to wily for the ſtranger, who was ſo inamoured with the liking of his gardens, that incontinently, and at his owne price he bought them. But when he came the next day with his friends to review his bargaine, hee found no veſſels there for fiſhing, and inquiring, whether on that day were a time of ſolemnity, and feaſting for fiſhermen, it was anſwered, that it was no ſuch time, neither were they ever wont before yeſterday to fiſh there. Now how could this ſtranger rightly complaine of cheating when hee ſo eagerly hunted after the leaſt ſhew, and ſhadow, that hee might feed his fond fantaſie with delight? And with what countenance could he reprove another of fraud, that himſelfe tooke ſo baſe advantage to ſerue his delights? For he that reproveth another of a fault, ought himſelfe to bee free from the ſame. I will not therefore fetch in ſuch trifles within the compaſſe of the eccleſiaſticall cenſure, which wholy condemneth all luſting after filthy lucre, and in a compendious frame of ſpeech, cenſureth ſeverely whatſoever light and loſe dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Wherefore what ſhall I ſay of him, who vp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on that teſtament, though coyned and framed by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother man, which he knowes to be falſe, challengeth to himſelfe an inheritance or legacy, and maketh gaine of another mans wickedneſſe, when even the publike lawes bind him over as guilty, who witting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly makes uſe of another mans falſehood? But the rule of juſtice is cleare for it, that it becommeth not a good man to decline from the truth, nor to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:265:172"/> damnifie another unjuſtly, neither to plot or wrap up cloſely any manner of fraud. What is more evident proofe for it, then that of <hi>Ananias,</hi> who tooke ſome<note n="e" place="margin">Acts 5.2.</note> portion fraudulently from the price of the fields, which himſelfe ſold, and layd downe in pretence the whole ſumme at the feet of the Apoſtle? Being convinced of hypocriſie fell he not<note n="f" place="margin">Verſe 5.</note> dead? It was lawfull for him to have offered (to God) no part at all, and this he might have done without deceit.

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:265:177"/> husbands, who all dyed. The juſt man was more jealous of anothers harmes, then deſirous to beſtow his owne daughter. How briefly reſolved hee all queſtions of the Philoſophers that might ariſe upon the point. They have three tractates concerning the faults of houſes to bee ſold: whether namely, they ought to be kept from the knowledge of the buier, or laied open: this man thinkes not good to cover, no not ſo much, as the ſecret frailties of his owne daughter. Hee affects not to move, but was moved for her. We need not doubt likewiſe of much more honeſty in this man, then in them, becauſe there is no compariſon to be made betweene the cauſe of match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a daughter, and the matter of commerce for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. Let us further conſider another thing, which being done in the time of our fathers captivity, bare the prime beauty of honeſty. For honeſty is hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by no adverſity, but therein is more illuſtrious, then in proſperity. In the middeſt of bonds, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, flames, ſervitude (which to free men is more grievous then all puniſhment) amidſt tormentors, the ruins of their countrie, the dreadfull terror of the living, where ſuch tragedies were acted, amidſt the wofull beholding the<note n="l" place="margin">Maccabees 7.8.</note> bloud of the ſlaine, the care of honeſty was not interrupted: but, when their manſions were converted into aſhes, ſhined forth moſt gloriouſly in their affections. Their ſtudy was not to bury their gold, nor hide their ſilver, thereby to reſerve it for their poſterity: but in their extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt calamity they had an eye to the ſafegard of their honeſty. This was in price with them, together with their holy religion, and therefore for the preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hereof, when they were to goe into <hi>Perſia,</hi> they hid the ſacred fire in ſecret,<note n="m" place="margin">1 Maccab. 1.19.</note> and ſolitary place, ſigning it with a ſeale, and covering it with ſilence, which is the ſureſt guard. That the impure might not pollute, nor the bloud of the ſlaine extinguiſh, nor the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:265:178"/> vgly ſhape of ruinous heapes aboliſh, this was their ſole indevour. Religion the roote, and crowne of honeſty, was that only, which by their captivity could not be wreſted from them, rightly then did they fixe their care vpon it, rightly alſo did they forecaſt to faſten it vpon their poſterity. Theſe, a long time after, when God put it into the mind of the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> to reſtore the temple in <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi> and the lawfull rites at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> returning with <hi>Nehemias,</hi> together with the of-ſpring of theſe Preiſts, who had hid the fire of the Lord taken from the altar, leſt it ſhould haue periſhed, comming to the place being a valley, in ſtead of fire, found thick water, which he commanded them to draw vp, bring it to him, ſprinkle it vpon the wood.</p>
                     <p>Thus then, which is to be admired, at the ſun obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before with clouds ſuddenly breaking forth with his bright beames, a great fire was kindled to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ioy of them all, <hi>Nehemias</hi>

Howbeit, the matter being of high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt importance, needfull it was for ſucceeding times, his Hydra's head ſtill ſpringing up, that ſome ſhould come in as champions to cut it downe: Wherefore <hi>Aurel.

And at laſt St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> himſelfe in that everlaſting monument of his<note n="f" place="margin">De Civitate Dei.</note> 22. bookes hath ſifted him to the branne, hunted him out of all his ſtarting holes, and looſing the liſts of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined lines hath quite, and cleane, like to a few Spiders webbes, ſwept them away with all their wiles. Thus you ſee, that all theſe (and many more not now extant) as ſo many malls, are hammering ſtill upon this ſtithy, and though they batter it every one in his turne, yet they never leave ſtriking till they have driven it to powder.</p>
                  <p>But this was one of the leaſt, not of the

All places are filled with the Majeſtie of God, neither is there any place ſafe to the perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious: but to affright from offending the preſence of religion availeth much. That Altar it is, that holds all men in concord, that Altar it is, that makes the faith of all men agree in one, neither doth any thing bring more authority to our ſentences, then an order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proceeding by oath, which determines all things.

But divine <hi>Conſtantius</hi> is reported to have done the ſame. Let us follow that Prince rather in matters of leſſe conſequence.

But now let them lift up the eyes of their mind, and body, and ſee among us an armie of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity, an ocean of integrity, a world of virginity. Here among our Virgins is no ornament of goodly riband for the head, but a poore veyle, yet pretious for the uſe of a pure life, no curious ſetting out upon all advantages, but a careleſſe regard of beauty: here are none of thoſe purple robes, none of thoſe diſhes of feaſting, and delicacy, but in coorſe habit the frequency of faſting, no priviledges, no rewards:
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:265:227"/> but rather all things ſo entertained, as if whilſt they practiſe chaſtity, they meant to extinguiſh in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the care of it. Howbeit, whilſt they ſo ſeriouſly exerciſe this duty, their care is not drawne away, but provoked, and drawne on to the performance of other imployments accompanying this their calling, and the ſame accumulated with ſundry diſaſters, and loſſes (theſe, and nothing but theſe are the profits they reape.) For it is not Virginity, which is purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon a price, but taken up upon love of Vertue. It is not integrity, which, as it were at a Faire, or publike ſale, is for a time hyred for a ſumme of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. Chaſtities firſt triumph is in the ſubduing of worldly luſts, becauſe the deſire of lucre makes the ſtrongeſt aſſault againſt the fort of ſhamefaſtneſſe. But let us admit that the ayde of augmentation ought to be beſtowed upon their Virgins, were they many in number, what then will the ſurpluſage be for the Chriſtian Virgins, what treaſurie will accordingly ſuffice for ſo great expences? Or if they ſuppoſe what is given ought to be conferred upon the Veſtals only, will it not turne to their open ſhame, that they which challenged the whole under <hi>Gentile</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, ſhould now under Chriſtian Princes thinke to abridge us, and that againſt common humanity, from ſharing with them in publick benevolence?</p>
